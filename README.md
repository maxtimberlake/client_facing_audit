<h2>Description</h2>
In my current role as a GRC Analyst, I conduct initial compliance assessments for internal stakeholders within their organizations. The attached document serves as an illustrative sample of such audits. Its primary objective is to demonstrate to the client the controls that are currently absent in their processes. It's crucial to emphasize that this document is designed with the client in mind, ensuring that it is both precise and easily comprehensible, even for individuals without a technical background. It is followed by a Risk Assesment that is meant to be a much more in-depth look into all the systems and what is currently in place and/or missing. The document and following Risk Assesment is based of a scenario and does contain any of my current or previous employers sensitive information.

I have included a PDF version for direct viewing on the github site. I also added a .xlsx file in-case you wanted to view it in a spreadsheet editor, as the pdf messes up the formatting a bit.
